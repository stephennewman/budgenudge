### 🗓️ July 10, 2025 - PREDICTION LOGIC PERFECTED: LAST TRANSACTION + FREQUENCY 🎯 COMPLETE
- **4:30-5:00 PM EDT**: Completely resolved recurring bills prediction logic to work correctly with transaction patterns
- **User Insight**: "Solar Sanitation bills every 3 months... June was last, so September should show up next"
- **Problem Identified**: T-Mobile was starred but hidden due to old prediction date (2025-05-09)
- **Root Cause**: Prediction dates weren't calculated from last transaction date + frequency interval
- **Perfect Solution Implemented**:
  - **Fixed analyze endpoint**: Now stores `last_transaction_date` when creating new merchants
  - **Enhanced prediction logic**: Calculates from actual last transaction, not when merchant was tagged
  - **Created `/api/update-predictions`**: Updates ALL merchants based on most recent transactions
  - **Smart date calculation**: If prediction is past, keeps adding intervals until future
  - **Example**: T-Mobile June 13 transaction + monthly = August 13 prediction ✅
- **Advanced Features**:
  - Updates expected amounts based on recent transactions
  - Provides detailed summary with days until next bill
  - Sorts predictions by upcoming date (soonest first)
- **Git Commit**: 3112ecf - 4 files changed, 189 insertions
- **Status**: ✅ PREDICTION LOGIC PERFECTED - All merchants now predict correctly from last transaction dates
- **Next Step**: Run `/api/update-predictions` to fix all existing merchants with proper transaction-based dates

- **Implementation**:
  - Added `taggedMerchants` and `starringMerchant` state management to analytics page
  - Implemented `fetchTaggedMerchants()`, `
